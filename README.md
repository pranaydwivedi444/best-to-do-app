# Best To-Do App

This is a simple to-do app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add and remove tasks, mark tasks as complete, and stores the tasks in local storage so they can be retrieved later even after a page reload.


## Features
- Add new tasks to the list
- Remove tasks from the list
- Delete List
- Mark tasks as complete
- Store tasks in local storage for retrieval after page reload

## Learnings - 
Task Management: Your project provides users with a task management system, allowing them to create lists and tasks, mark tasks as complete, and clear completed tasks.

List Selection: Users can select a specific list to view its tasks. This feature enhances user experience by making it easier to organize and manage tasks within specific categories.

CRUD Functionality: The project provides full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality for lists and tasks, allowing users to create and delete lists and tasks, as well as update and edit their contents.

Responsive Design: The application's design is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures a seamless user experience across various platforms.

Model-View-Controller Architecture: The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, separating the data, presentation, and control logic of the application. This architecture promotes modular development, making it easier to maintain and scale the application in the future.
