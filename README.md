```bash
 git clone https://github.com/pranaydwivedi444/best-to-do-app.git

Usage
To add a new task, simply type the task into the input field and press the "Enter" key or click the "Add" button. To remove a task, click the "X" button next to the task. To mark a task as complete, click the checkbox next to the task.

All tasks are stored in local storage, so they will be retrieved even after a page reload.
